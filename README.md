Use client-side scripting in PocketMine-MP!

## Some things to remember:
This proof of concept was based off of [a pull request on PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/2871) by [@Spajker7](https://github.com/Spajker7) and from [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) internals from around ___April of 2019___.

That being said, please don't expect stuff to still work. I don't have the time and interest to update this anymore as this used to be a private repository to prove that it is possible with an external PocketMine-MP plugin.

Don't bug me about stuff not working, but if you do fix it, please open a Pull Request and I'll be more than happy to merge it. [TeaSpoon](https://github.com/CortexPE/TeaSpoon) died of inactivity because it is not worth my time anymore, I get nothing from it.

This repository was publicized in hopes that other people may improve it, or build things for/on it for the improvement of the MC:Bedrock open source community. Have fun, just abide by the AGPL v3 License 😜
